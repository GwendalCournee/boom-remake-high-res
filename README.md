## ABOUT Boom High Resolution fork ##

This repository is a fork of the Lifish engine, with very few changes made, and only on Boom Branch.

All graphical assets have been 4x upscaled using IA, and some parameters (speed, size of a tile, etc.) have been adapted for the new size of assets.


## ABOUT ##
Lifish is a work-in-progress arcade old-style game inspired by Factor Software's BOOM. 

The Lifish engine was used to create [BOOM Remake](https://silverweed.github.io/boom), a faithful remake of the original BOOM game.

Lifish comes with a (Work In Progress) level editor, currently working only on Linux and MacOS: [LifishEdit](https://github.com/silverweed/lifish-edit). This also works for the BOOM Remake mod.

### Main game planned release ###
Once the main work is done, Lifish will be released for the current platforms:

* Windows 64 bit (probably >= Vista)
* Linux (somewhat recent versions of `libc` and `libstdc++` are needed; to be precise,
  your distro must support `GLIBC_2.17` and `GLIBCXX_3.4.20`.)
* OS X
* Probably FreeBSD

See later for instructions on how to build the game from the sources.

## Building ##

### DEPENDENCIES ###

* [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) >= 2.4
* [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (included in the source)

#### Linux, OS X, BSD, etc ####
The game can be compiled on *nix (tested on Linux, OSX and FreeBSD) via `cmake . && make`
(you need to have SFML >=2.4 installed).

#### Windows ####
On Windows you can either use VS2015 (or later), or a Unix-like environment like MinGW-w64 (I use the TDM-GCC compiler).

If you use the latter, you can follow the steps on
[this guide](http://ascend4.org/Setting_up_a_MinGW-w64_build_environment) until the *MinGW-w64*
chapter (included -- you can skip the *First steps* section, as all the listed dependencies like Python etc
aren't required). Remember to `cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" .`, otherwise cmake will probably
generate a VS makefile.

### Command line parameters ###
If launched from the command line, `lifish` accepts a bunch of parameters (see `lifish -h` for details).
It also accepts an optional argument which is the path of the level JSON to use (default: `lifish.json`).

### Note about assets ###
The graphics and sounds you'll find in `assets` are placeholder. No graphic asset is even close to being final, and the final
assets won't be uploaded on this repo, as they'll be available for purchase in the official release.
